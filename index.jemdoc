I am a Project Assistant Professor at [https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/ National Institute of Informatics (NII)] in Tokyo, Japan. I work in the project [https://www.jst.go.jp/erato/hasuo/en/ ERATO MMSD] headed by Prof.Dr. [https://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/ Ichiro Hasuo]. \n\n From November 2020 to October 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher working in the Rigorous Software Engineering Group headed by Prof.Dr. [https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/ Rupak Majumdar] \n at [https://www.mpi-sws.org/ Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)] in Kaiserslautern, Germany. \n\n
I obtained my PhD degree in Software Engineering from [https://en.tongji.edu.cn/ School of Software Engineering, Tongji University] in July 2020. (advisors: [http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/Data/View/2827 Miaomiao Zhang] and [http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/ Naijun Zhan]). \n Before that, I also obtained my Bachelor degree and Master degree both in Software Engineering from the same university. \n
From 2017 to 2020, I was also a visiting PhD student at [http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/index.php/en/ SKLCS, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences] where I was advised by Prof.Dr. [http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/ Naijun Zhan].\n\n
